# Random-Android-Tests

This is a repo containing various tests and prototypes for any ideas or problems I find interesting.
No concern for code quality is given for any of these tests.
The purpose is to get out an MVP as quick as possible.

Click on each folder to view a stand-alone project with details about what it's for.
